#Individual Project

###Project Description:
My project is based on an ASL alphabet. I will have an input field where a user can enter a letter. The hand sign for that letter will then appear on the screen. When they type in the next letter they want to learn, the first letter will move to a saved section on the top of the screen. This way, they can write out a whole sentence to practice and see each letter displayed before them. There will be a play option which will allow them to play back each of the letters in the sentence at 5 second increments.
